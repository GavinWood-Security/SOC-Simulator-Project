# SOC Simulator Project

This project showcases my ability to identify, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using a simulated Security Operations Center environment provided by TryHackMe.

## Project Overview

Using the TryHackMe SOC Simulator, I assumed the role of a SOC Analyst, triaging real-world alerts, analyzing malicious behavior, and escalating true positives based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- **SIEM Log Analysis** (Splunk)
- **Threat Hunting** based on indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** for alert classification
- **Incident Reporting** & investigation narratives
- **Suspicious IP & Domain Research** using tools like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, etc.
- **Alert Prioritization & Triage** for effective escalation

## Included Files

- `investigation_report.md` – My write-up for each alert investigated
- `IOCs.txt` – List of extracted indicators (IP addresses, domains, hashes)
- `screenshots/` – Visual proof of log analysis and alert escalations
- `README.md` – You're reading it!

## Key Takeaways

- Hands-on practice simulating a real SOC analyst role
- Strengthened familiarity with blue team tooling and workflows
- Improved response playbook understanding and detection logic
